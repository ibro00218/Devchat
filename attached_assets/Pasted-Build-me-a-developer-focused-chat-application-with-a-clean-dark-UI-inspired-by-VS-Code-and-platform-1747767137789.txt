Build me a developer-focused chat application with a clean, dark UI inspired by VS Code and platforms like Discord. The UI should include a sidebar for friends and group (party) chats, and the main chat window must support code sharing with perfect formatting and syntax highlighting.

Core Requirements:
Dark UI Design:

Minimal and elegant layout

Left sidebar: Friends, Groups, “New Party” button

Right chat window: Messages, user names, timestamps

Code Snippet Support:

Support unlimited characters in code blocks

Perfect alignment, indentation, and color syntax

Code should be displayed using syntax highlighting (use Prism.js, Highlight.js, Monaco, or CodeMirror)

Preserve tabs, spaces, and newlines exactly as written

Copy Code Feature:

Add a “Copy” button on every code block

Clicking should copy the entire snippet to clipboard

Show tooltip “Copied!” after click

Multi-Language Syntax Support:

Detect or manually select code language

Support at least: JavaScript, Python, C/C++, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, JSON, TypeScript, Shell, etc.

Code Editor Input:

Allow users to write and send code in an expandable editor input

Use textarea or Monaco/CodeMirror for writing

Resizable input box with scroll

Advanced Features (Optional but Desired):
Real-time chat using Socket.io or Firebase

Message reactions and thread replies

Snippet bookmarking and tagging

Code preview for HTML/CSS/JS (sandboxed)

GitHub/GitLab integration for commits, PRs, issues

Syntax theme selector (Dracula, Monokai, Night Owl, etc.)

Export snippet as .txt or shareable link

Snippet expiration (auto delete)

Voice/video calling with screen sharing for code



🌐 Platform Independence
Works on Windows, Mac, Linux — and even on mobile.

Everything runs in browser (with optional backend for execution).

Great for global teams with mixed devices.

🧑‍💻 Developer-Friendly Experience
Directly write, edit & run code without leaving the chat app.

Makes it a one-stop platform — like Discord + VS Code.

Useful for hackathons, code review sessions, mentorship, etc.

. 🛠️ Real-Time Collaboration
Users can share code, run snippets, and debug together.

Pair programming, live Q&A, and quick prototyping become super easy.

Helps remote dev teams or student groups work faster.
